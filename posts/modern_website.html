									<p>Early on in my career I though that I'll do front-end work 3 times: first time, last time and never again. Not saying that there is anything wrong with front-end engineers mind you - it's just that I like to approach software design and development as puzzle solving and front end is just not my kind of puzzle.</p>
                                    <h3 id="old">World I'm used to</h3>
                                    <p>Last time I educated myself regarding front-end development it was the year 2006. Apart from HTML, CSS was a big thing and everyone was using Adobe Flash to create dynamic content - mind you, it was still called Macromedia Flash back then. Folks were still using Windows XP and Microsoft FrontPage was considered powerful tool and best choice for small and simple websites. I remember using Microsoft Expression Web and finding it a bit of an overkill in most aspects... yes, I was using a lot of Microsoft software back then. Since, a lot has changed</p>
                                    <h3 id="new">Changes</h3>
                                    <p>Since then, Web 2.0 has stopped being a buzzword, we have really fast JavaScript interpreters and HTML5 is a thing for a while now. Sites are not longer required to be just practical nor just beautiful but also interactive. More often than not, sites are accessed from mobile devices. So what can a poor fellow like me do in this new world when he decided that he needs a personal website?</p>
                                    <p>First of all, let's get reacquainted with old friends. I refreshed my memory of HTML and went through what's new in HTML5. I also refreshed my CSS and looked up several JavaScript tutorials. I did get the basics covered but that still does not make me even remotely competent to create my own website (unless I decide to make it a show of what not to do). It would take me forever to develop anything that even remotely resembles a modern, responsive web page. So, I did what all successful software engineers do when faced with a problem too hard for them to solve in given time: I decided to see if there is solution out there I can use.</p>
                                    <h3 id="solution">Complete solution, least control </h3>
                                    <p> I was not a bit surprised that there are a lot of existing solutions that help you create your web-site. Out of a lot of solutions that are there, I found several that I find worth mentioning. </p>
                                    <p> <a href="http://www.jimdo.com/">Jimdo</a> has great choice of themes and once you chose theme it's mostly easy to develop on top of it. It required too much color-picking for me so I realized that it's probably not for me.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> More or less similar was my experience with <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. The problem I had with Wix was that they actually offered me too much choice - I was looking for something that does not require me to spend a lot of time and it definitely did not work out. </p>
                                    <p> I'd recommend this for anyone who wants their site to be pretty and does not want to touch HTML/CSS - otherwise, you might want to consider something else.
                                    <h3 id="builder">Site builders</h3>
                                    <p>Important lesson I took from checking options similar to <a href="http://www.jimdo.com/">Jimdo</a> and <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> was that I might not have to write HTML and CSS to create my website. There has to be something like Markdown to HTML converter or something similar. </p>
                                    <p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> let's you write markdown and it generates HTML. It's supposed to be easy to set up blogs and sites. The only downside I found was that it relies on Ruby. I've never worked with Ruby before and I did not want to risk setting it up taking too much time. Besides, if I'm going to spend a lot of time learning new syntax for templates I might as well just edit HTML directly... oh, wait - that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.</p>
                                    <p>Another option was to use <a href="https://sway.com/">Sway</a> but while it initially seemed like a great tool it's best for presentations, not sites. For more than 10 minutes I could not find an option to export what I've made and download it. Therefore, it's not that great.
                                    <h3 id="winner">So, who's the winner?</h3>
                                    <p>There's no winner. As always, there is no single tool that gives me enough freedom but lets me focus on the content. So, I did what I should have done in the first place: I downloaded HTML template and started modifying it to make it best fit for my needs. I'll just expand HTML file every time I want to make a new entry. Quick and dirty. What does not kill you...
